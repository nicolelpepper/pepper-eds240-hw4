## 1. Which option do you plan to pursue? 

Infographic

## 2. Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If yes, how so?
My questions have completely changed from HW1 since I decided to change the data that I'm using. I am now using a complied dataset from the TNC on salmon abundance in California.

The new primary question that I'm exploring is:
How has winter-run Chinook Salmon abundance in California changed over time?

My sub questions are:
1) How has historic Chinook salmon abundance changed over time for different spawning groups? (spoiler - winter run chinook salmon are on the endangered species list)
2) How does stream water temperature impact Chinook salmon abundance for winter-run salmon?
3) How have damns impacted winter-run Chinook salmon habitat?

## 3. Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s), and how.

#### 1) How has historic Chinook salmon abundance changed over time for different spawning groups? (spoiler - winter run chinook salmon are on the endangered species list)
I have a data set on salmon river abundance since the 1980s (`salmon_ca`), it contains species (`c_name`), run time (`r_timing`), abundance (`abun_estimate`), and year (`y_end`). Since I'm just interested in Chinook Salmon, first I filtered species to only include Chinook. Next, to calculate the percent of historic salmon abundance that remains, I calculated the average abundance for two time periods: 1970-1980 for historic abundance and 2015 - 2025 for current abundance and then calculated the percent that percent of historic abundance that remains. This provides me with different percentages of historic abundance for each of the run-timing Chinook groups.

#### 2) How does stream water temperature impact Chinook salmon abundance for winter-run salmon?
I will use two data sets to answer this question, one will be the same data on salmon abundance and the other will be water temperature for stream gauge in Northern California. I have filtered the salmon abundance data for winter-run Chinook salmon. I've created a line chart with different annotations for important features to point out including when the species was listed on the federal endangered species list, a time period when increased flow from the delta improved salmon abundance, and how another recent project temporarily increased salmon abundance. Since winter run Chinook are particularly sensitive to warm temperatures since they spawn in the how summer months I thought that it could be interesting to annotate the graph to indicate years where the water temperature passed the safe temperature threshold for salmon spawning. I will do this by getting the median for the the top ten days of temp and then 

#### 3) How have damns impacted winter-run Chinook salmon habitat?
For this I'm going to make a map of how historic salmon abundance has changed over time. I have background data for the boundary of California, and an outline of historic habitat and current habitat up until it is impassible (at Keswick Dam). I am going to color rivers by their percent of historic chinook winter-run abundance that remains at the rivers . I will do this by calculating the percent historic abundance in the salmon data and then joining it by river (`w_name`) with the river name in my river shapefile.

![](images/salmon-inspo.png)
I like the use of annotations and the use of spanning under the geometry of the line graph.


![](images/temp-inspo.png)
It could be cool to show the amount of days/month that exceed the safe river temperature threshold and how that has changed over the years. I like how they ordered the data from top left, so 01/01 starts on the top left, I think this is intuative and I may do that if I start with Jan on top and the first year I look at next to it up top.

7. Answer the following questions:

a. What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations (from #6, above), describe those challenges here.

It was tricky to choose the right kind of visualization. I still have some thinking to do for my second 2 plots.

b. What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven’t covered in class that you’ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?
I'm using some GIS tools that we haven't covered yet since I'm making a map.

c. What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?
I need to think more about how to visualize the spatial trend/distribution.
